* Unzip the file and change the folder name to "project".
* Set the working directory in which run_analysis.R is saved.
* Run source("run_analysis.R") in R.
* There are 2 output files generated: "tidy_data_set.txt" (contains the first tidy data set for mean and std columns) and "means_tidy.txt" (contains the second tidy data set with the average of each variable grouped by "subject" and "activity").
* Both files will be generated in your actual working directory.
